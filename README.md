# School Of Code BootCamp (SoC)
## About Soc
School of Code (SoC) is a software development mentoring Bootcamp organised by Google Developers Group OAU (GDG OAU) in collaboration with IEEE OAU Student Branch and Intel OAU.

More experienced members of the community take 2–3 mentees for 2 weeks and introduce them to Google technologies covering topics in Mobile & Web Development, Data Science, Machine Learning, etc.

The bootcamp cycle lasts for about a month and is divided into 3 stages

**Stage One**: Students are assigned to mentors and undergo 2 - 3 weeks of intensive training, 4 hours daily. General classes also hold during this stage to introduce the students to technologies like Git/GitHub, and Heroku.

**Stage Two**: Students are divided into teams. Each team comes up with a project and spends the next week implementing the idea. This stage helps to measure the progress of students and also teach vitals skills necessary to be a team player. This stage is rounded up by a Demo/Exhibition Day.

**Stage Three**: The mentors work with the teams to implement changes suggested during the demo and and thereafter, the project is deployed live!
