# School Of Code BootCamp (SoC)
## About Soc
School of Code (SoC) is a software development mentoring Bootcamp organised by Google Developers Group OAU (GDG OAU) in collaboration with IEEE OAU Student Branch and Intel OAU.

More experienced members of the community take 2â€“3 mentees for 2 weeks and introduce them to Google technologies covering topics in Mobile & Web Development, Data Science, Machine Learning, etc.

The bootcamp cycle lasts for about a month and is divided into 3 stages

**Stage One**: Students are assigned to mentors and undergo 2 - 3 weeks of intensive training, 4 hours daily. General classes also hold during this stage to introduce the students to technologies like Git/GitHub, and Heroku.

**Stage Two**: Students are divided into teams. Each team comes up with a project and spends the next week implementing the idea. This stage helps to measure the progress of students and also teach vitals skills necessary to be a team player. This stage is rounded up by a Demo/Exhibition Day.

**Stage Three**: The mentors work with the teams to implement changes suggested during the demo and and thereafter, the project is deployed live!
